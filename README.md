Vane unifies multimodal data, intelligence, and continuous learning with Python and SQL interfaces, seamlessly scaling from local environments to Ray clusters.

![Vane platform overview](assets/vane-platform.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Project status**
>
> - **Vane Data** — Supports most of the capabilities described below and is under active development, but is **not yet production-ready**. Its interfaces and internals may continue to evolve as the codebase is reviewed and hardened.
> - **Vane RL** and **Vane Agent** — In the early stages of design and implementation. Their source code will be released in future updates.
  - **Vibe Coding and Agentic Engineering** — Some parts of our system were initially built through Vibe Coding. We are now continuously analyzing, understanding, and improving the codebase, applying an Agentic Engineering approach to drive iterative optimization and enhance the quality, maintainability, and efficiency of the system.

## Vane Data

Vane Data is a high-performance, multimodal-native data engine for AI workloads. Built on a fork of [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org), it extends the core execution engine with native multimodal processing and a unified framework for local and distributed execution.

### Key Features

- **Multimodal-native processing** — Process images, video, audio, text, documents, events, sensor data, and tables through a unified type system. Dynamic batching and backpressure control handle variations in data size and computational cost.
- **Python and SQL interfaces** — Build data and AI pipelines with DuckDB SQL or the Python Relation API.
- **Built-in AI operations** — Invoke LLMs, generate embeddings, and run batch inference through OpenAI and Anthropic APIs or native vLLM integration. Prefix-aware bucketing improves vLLM prefix-cache hit rates and inference throughput.
- **Heterogeneous execution** — Overlap CPU, GPU, I/O, and model inference workloads through asynchronous scheduling.
- **Local-to-cloud execution** — Run the same pipeline locally or across distributed Ray clusters, with a foundation for future edge-cloud coordination.
- **Designed for production AI workloads** — Build multimodal training-data preprocessing pipelines and enterprise-scale batch inference workflows.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Vane supports Python 3.10 through 3.14. Python 3.12 is recommended and is the primary development version.

Install the `vane-ai` package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install vane-ai
```

Optional features are provided as extras:

```bash
pip install 'vane-ai[openai]'   # OpenAI provider (anthropic / google / transformers / vllm likewise)
pip install 'vane-ai[image]'    # ndarray image inputs for AI providers (Pillow)
pip install 'vane-ai[video]'    # video data source (Pillow, psutil, decord)
```

The `video` extra installs `decord` on Linux x86-64 only, matching the platforms covered by its prebuilt wheels.

For more details, see the [Installation Guide](https://vane.astrovela.ai/docs/data/quickstart/installation).

### Quick Start

Follow the [Quickstart guide](https://vane.astrovela.ai/docs/data/quickstart/quickstart) to build and run your first Vane pipeline.

## Multimodal Inference Benchmarks

Hardware configuration: 1 node, 36 CPU cores, 64 GB memory, and 1× NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (22 GB VRAM).

We use the [Ray Data benchmark suite](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/ray-data-daft-benchmarking-multimodal-ai-workloads) to compare Vane with Ray Data and Daft. The [benchmark source code](multimodal_inference_benchmarks) is included in this repository.

![Multimodal inference benchmark comparing Vane Data, Ray Data, and Daft](assets/benchmark.png)

The Ray runner targets distributed workloads. The current results are single-node only; validation on the multi-node environments used in the Ray Data benchmarks is still pending.

See the [benchmarking page](https://vane.astrovela.ai/benchmarks) for detailed results.
